        "description": "Internships and fresher jobs are both great options for those new to the workforce. The main difference between an internship and a fresher job is that internships are usually temporary, part-time positions that provide hands-on experience in a particular field. Internships are often unpaid or low-paying, and the duration of the position is usually shorter than that of a fresher job. In short, fresher jobs are usually full-time, paid positions with more responsibility and a longer duration."
